    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: <br>\n",
    "Because of limited GPU hours, I decided to move to Google Colab. I tried various models, and below answers are as per the BLEU scores that I obtained on colab. Once I decided my final model architecture and all the parameters, I trained a model here in Udacity workspace with that config.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Encoder*: <br>\n",
    "Tried VGG16 and ResNet50 for creating the encoder. When I compared their BLEU scores, ResNet50 performed better. <br>\n",
    "VGG16 has many more parameters compared to that in ResNet50. Thus, training VGG16 took longer, and its checkpoint files were quite big (~500 MB compared to ~100MB for ResNet50).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decoder*:<br>\n",
    "Tried 1 and 2 LSTM layers for decoder network. Decoder with 2 LSTM layers gave better BLEU scores, so decided to have 2 LSTM layers in my model.\n",
    "With 2 LSTM layers, I tried dropout of 0.2 and 0.4. Both gave lower BLEU scores, so I have not added any dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "*batch_size*:<br>\n",
    "Tried various values for batch size (e.g. 64, 128, 256, 512). If batch size is very small, you will see a lot of fluctuations in loss value in each epoch. On the other hand, if it is very large, you may get 'out of memory' errors. Also, having larger batch size means more parallelization. <br>\n",
    "After comparing models trained using sizes 256 and 512, I decided to use 512 since it showed small improvement in BLEU score.\n",
    "\n",
    "*vocab_threshold*:<br>\n",
    "As per [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf), decided to use 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "*embed_size and hidden_size*:<br>\n",
    "Tried various permutations of values for these two parameters. e.g. (256, 256), (256, 512), (512, 512), etc.\n",
    "The combination (256, 1024) gave comparatively better BLEU scores, so decided to use these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried below transformations. <br>\n",
    "    &emsp; &emsp; RandomRotation(degrees=20) <br>\n",
    "    &emsp; &emsp; GaussianBlur(kernel_size=3) <br>\n",
    "    &emsp; &emsp; RandomAutocontrast() <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried them one-by-one as well as together, but every time I got comparatively lower BLEU score. Thus, I decided to not add any additional transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively speaking: <br>\n",
    "I am using a CNN that is already trained on a large number of variety of images. So, after removing the classification layer, the output of the last layer of this CNN should be same (or nearly same) irrespective of whether we use some transformation or not. <br>\n",
    "In other words, since the encoder \"encodes\" the content of the input image, its output should be same even if we rotate, blur, etc. Thus, I think, applying any transformations is not likely to help much.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I am using a pre-trained CNN model (ResNet50) as an encoder. Since it is already trained, its parameters should not be modified. However, I have removed the classification layer from this CNN and, in its place, have added an embedding layer. This embedding layer is completely new, so its parameters need be trained.\n",
    "In decoder, I am using 2 LSTM layers and 1 FC layer. Again, these are completely new layers. Hence, their parameters should also be modified during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I selected the parameters in the embedding layer and the decoder for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "In SGD optimizer, you need to manually set the learning rate, whereas in Adam optimizer, you can manually set the learning rate but you are not required to. If you don't specify the learning rate, Adam optimizer automatically finds a good value.<br>\n",
    "Also, as you train your model, you should reduce learning rate (\"learning rate decay\") after few epochs. In SGD, you need to decide yourself when you should change the learning rate and what the new learning rate should be. In Adam optimizer however this is done automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Adam optimizer also has some mathematical improvements compared to SGD. For example, it uses running average of gradients while updating model parameters. This leads to lesser fluctuations in loss and also reduces the chance of model getting stuck in a local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried both SGD and Adam optimizer. With SGD, perplexity was stuck at ~10, even when I reduced the learning rate a couple of times during training. With Adam optimizer, I managed to get perplexity <10. So, I chose Adam optimizer for training the final model."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
