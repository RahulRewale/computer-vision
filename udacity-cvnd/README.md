This folder contains the three projects that I implemented for Computer Vision nano-degree from Udacity. The projects are as follows:
  1) Facial Keypoint Detection (Using Haar Cascades & CNN)
  2) Image Captioning (Using CNN & LSTM)
  3) Graph based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) in 2D grid

The files were uploaded as they were in the Udacity workspace, so there are a lot of comments, images, etc.

*TODO*
1) Migrate from PyTorch to Tensorflow
2) Clean up the code
