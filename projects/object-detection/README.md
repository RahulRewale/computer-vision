# Object Detection Projects

#### object-detecion-using-tf-api: <br/>
Contains code for detecting 10 different classes of objects using Tensorflow Object Detection API and Faster R-CNN model.
<br/>

#### yolov1: <br/>
Contains yolov1 implementation from scratch. The implementation is *almost* complete. It seems that there may be some bug(s) because of which output is not that accurate.
